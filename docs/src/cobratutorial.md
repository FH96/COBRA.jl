# COBRA.jl - Tutorial

This tutorial serves as a quick start guide as well as an interactive reference for more advanced users. Download the live notebook [here](https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.jl/tree/master/docs/tutorial).

## Installation

If you do not already have the `COBRA.jl` package installed, you must first first follow the installation instructions [here](http://opencobra.github.io/COBRA.jl/).

> Please note that should you run this tutorial on an already configured system. Otherwise, the following lines will throw an error message.

Before running any function of `COBRA.jl`, it is necessary to include the `COBRA.jl` module:


```julia
using COBRA
```

You can test your system by running:


```julia
COBRA.checkSysConfig();
```

## Beginner's Guide

Should you not have any prior experience with Julia and/or Linux, **read carefully** the [Beginner's Guide](http://opencobra.github.io/COBRA.jl/stable/cobratutorial.html). If you however feel that you are set to proceed with this tutorial, please consider the Beginner's Guide as a go-to reference in case you are running into any issues. If you see unusual behavior, you may consider reading the [FAQ section](http://opencobra.github.io/COBRA.jl/stable/faq.html).

### Quick help

Do you feel lost or you donâ€™t know the meaning of certain input parameters? Try typing a question mark at the Julia REPL followed by a keyword. For instance:

```julia
julia> ? distributedFBA
```

### Installation check and package testing

Make sure that you have a working installation of `MathProgBase.jl` and at least one of the supported solvers. You may find further information [here](http://mathprogbasejl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

If you want to install other solvers such as `CPLEX`, `CLP`, `Gurobi`, or `Mosek`, you can find more information [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt).

You may, at any time, check the integrity of the `COBRA.jl` package by running:

```Julia
julia> Pkg.test("COBRA")
```

The code has been benchmarked against the `fastFVA` implementation [[3](#References-1)]. The modules and solvers are correctly installed when all tests pass without errors (warnings may appear).

## Adding local workers

The connection functions are given in `connect.jl`, which, if a parallel version is desired, must be included separately:


```julia
include("$(Pkg.dir("COBRA"))/src/connect.jl")
```

You may add local workers as follows:


```julia
# specify the total number of parallel workers
nWorkers = 4 

# create a parallel pool
workersPool, nWorkers = createPool(nWorkers) 
```

    [1m[34mINFO: Parallel version - Connecting the 4 workers ...
    [0m

    [1m[34m4 local workers are connected. (+1) on host: macbookpro-uni-lu.local
    [0m




    ([2,3,4,5],4)



The IDs of the respective workers are given in `workersPool`, and the number of local workers is stored in `nWorkers`.

In order to be able to use the `COBRA` module on all connected workers, you must invoke:


```julia
@everywhere using COBRA;
```

## Define and change the COBRA solver

Before the COBRA solver can be defined, the solver parameters and configuration must be loaded after having set the `solverName` (solver must be installed):

- `:GLPKMathProgInterface`
- `:CPLEX`
- `:Clp`
- `:Gurobi`
- `:Mosek`


```julia
# specify the solver name
solverName = :GLPKMathProgInterface

# include the solver configuration file
include("$(Pkg.dir("COBRA"))/config/solverCfg.jl")
```




    2-element Array{Any,1}:
         :Simplex
     true        




```julia
# change the COBRA solver
solver = changeCobraSolver(solverName, solParams)
```




    COBRA.SolverConfig("GLPK",GLPKMathProgInterface.GLPKInterfaceLP.GLPKSolverLP(true,:Simplex,Any[]))



where `solParams` is an array with the definition of the solver parameters.

## Load a COBRA model

As a test and as an example, the *E.coli* core model may be loaded as:


```julia
# download the test model
using Requests
include("$(Pkg.dir("COBRA"))/test/getTestModel.jl")
getTestModel()
```

    [1m[34mINFO: The ecoli_core model already exists.
    [0m

Load the stoichiometric matrix S from a MATLAB `structure` named model in the specified .mat file


```julia
model = loadModel("ecoli_core_model.mat", "S", "model");
```

    [1m[34mINFO: The model objective is set to be maximized.
    [0m[1m[34mINFO: All constraints assumed equality constaints.
    [0m

where `S` is the name of the field of the stoichiometric matrix and `model` is the name of the model. Note the semicolon that suppresses the ouput of `model`.


## Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)

In order to run a flux balance analysis (FBA), `distributedFBA` can be invoked with only 1 reaction and without an extra condition:


```julia
# set the reaction list (only one reaction)
rxnsList = 13

# select the reaction optimization mode
#  0: only minimization
#  1: only maximization
#  2: maximization and minimization
rxnsOptMode = 1

# launch the distributedFBA process with only 1 reaction on 1 worker
minFlux, maxFlux  = distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers=1, rxnsList=rxnsList, rxnsOptMode=rxnsOptMode);
```

    [1m[34mOriginal FBA. No additional constraints have been added.
    [0m >> Only 1 reaction of 95 will be solved (~ 1.0526315789473684 %).
    
     -- Maximization (iRound = 1). Block 1 [1/95].


where the reaction number `13` is solved. Note that the no extra conditions are added to the model (last function argument is `false`). The minimum flux and maximum flux can hence be listed as:


```julia
maxFlux[rxnsList]
```




    0.8739215069684303



## Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)

In order to run a common flux variability analysis (FVA), `distributedFBA` can be invoked with all reactions as follows:


```julia
# launch the distributedFBA process with all reactions
minFlux, maxFlux, optSol, fbaSol, fvamin, fvamax = distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers=4, optPercentage=90.0, preFBA=true);
```

## Distributed FBA of distinct reactions

You may now input several reactions with various `rxnsOptMode` values to run specific optimization problems.


```julia
rxnsList = [1; 18; 10; 20:30; 90; 93; 95]
rxnsOptMode = [0; 1; 2; 2+zeros(Int, length(20:30)); 2; 1; 0]

# run only a few reactions with rxnsOptMode and rxnsList
# distributedFBA(model, solver, nWorkers, optPercentage, objective, rxnsList, strategy, preFBA, rxnsOptMode)
minFlux, maxFlux, optSol, fbaSol, fvamin, fvamax, statussolmin, statussolmax = distributedFBA(model, solver);
```

Note that the reactions can be input as an unordered list.

## Saving the variables

You can save the output of `distributedFBA` by using:


```julia
saveDistributedFBA("results.mat")
```

    Saving minFlux (T:> Array{Float64,1}) ...[1m[32mDone.

    [0m[1m[32mAll available variables saved to results.mat.
    [0m

Note that the results are saved in a `.mat` file that can be opened in MATLAB for further processing.

## Cleanup

In order to cleanup the files generated during this tutorial, you can remove the files using:


```julia
rm("ecoli_core_model.mat")
rm("results.mat")
```
